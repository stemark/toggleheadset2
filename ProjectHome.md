This is an open source project originally intended for use with the now legacy Android 1.6 (donut) release and 3.5mm headphone jack HTC multi adapters on the G1 due to [android issue 2534](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2534).

Since release, lots of people have downloaded and used this application to fix hardware problems with their phones - specifically cases where the headphones connector detection doesn't work and your audio doesn't automatically switch to the correct output automatically.  This has been a surprisingly common occurrence.

## Supported Android Versions ##

## Update 6/8/2014 ##
I haven't had a chance to make changes necessary for the latest version of Android OS.  There are some comments about changes which can be made to support in [the wiki](https://code.google.com/p/toggleheadset2/issues/detail?id=14) if you'd like to hack on this.  I don't personally use this ap anymore and therefore it's not making it high enough on my priorities list.

If you aren't a developer I recommend you take a look at the [SoundAbout](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woodslink.android.wiredheadphoneroutingfix) application.  I've had several people tell me this has solved their problems with the latest Android operating systems.

## Update 2.0 4/4/11 ##
Thanks to Adam King we have a working application for android 2.0 and above.  Android 2.0 does not have the headset routing bug found in android 1.5 and 1.6, however several users have e-mailed after their headset routing jack hardware broke and incorrectly indicated the wrong headset state.  With the fix from Adam the widget now works with 2.0 and above to manually route to your speaker instead of headset and override the hardware detect.  Note: I've limited to 2.3 and below with the market version since this has not been tested on Android 3.0.  If you'd like to test on 3.0 or above please e-mail me at danwalkes at gmail.

## Update 2.2 3/31/12 ##
The widget can be configured at placement to support forcing speaker routing on startup automatically (regardless of the setting of the headset detect switch).  This may be useful if your phone headset jack detect switch is broken and your phone always thinks the headset is connected when it is not.

Also - added support for 4.0.3
